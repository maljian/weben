Do you need to create Swiss payment slips (called ES or ESR) as PDF files in a project of yours?
Then you found almost the right place, go to [SwissPaymentSlipFpdf](https://github.com/ravage84/SwissPaymentSlipFpdf)
or [SwissPaymentSlipTcpdf](https://github.com/ravage84/SwissPaymentSlipTcpdf).

If you want to create Swiss payment slips as PDF files in your PHP code base
but want to use neither FPDF nor TCPDF, then you can use this project.

### Requirements

### Composer

Just [install composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#system-requirements) on your system, if not already there.
Then create a [composer.json](http://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md) file in your project's root folder and copy the following into it:

```JSON
{
    "require": {
        "swiss-payment-slip/swiss-payment-slipPdf": "*"

After that you can install the package using

    $ php composer.phar install

in your project's root folder.

Background Story
----------------

In february 2013 I was looking for a solution to create swiss payment slips for a project I had to do at my work place.
After a short Google search I came across Manuel Reinhard's
[blog post](http://sprain.ch/blog/downloads/class-esr-besr-einzahlungsschein-php/) about the class he made for that.
On his [Github project's page](https://github.com/sprain/class.Einzahlungsschein.php) I found
[Peter Siska's](https://github.com/peschee) [pull request](https://github.com/sprain/class.Einzahlungsschein.php/pull/5).
His pull request introduced PSR-0 compatibility and he created a composer package on [Packagist](http://packagist.org/).
So I tried Peter's version and it suited my basic needs.

BUT since the customer I was working for used custom designed payment slips I couldn't use Manuel's/Peter's script
since it wasn't flexible enough.
Now I had to decide whether I want to "just" change the script to fit my needs or to rewrite it and
make it as flexible as possible.
I decided myself for the latter.

TODOs
